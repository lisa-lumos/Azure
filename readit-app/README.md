# The ReadIt App
The ReadIt App is a bookshop on the cloud, that simulates a full-blown real life bookshop. It contains 4 main services: 
- Books catalog - to pick the book you want to buy
- Shopping Cart
- Inventory Management
- Order Engine

The app starts from local and then is put to the cloud. The app is developed using .NET Core and nodeJS, and uses various databases. 

## .NET download
`https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download` to get .NET SDK 6.0 and .NET Core SDK (v3.1). Then open a new Terminal, and `dotnet --version` to check. Have problems with NuGet with M1 Mac, just ignore it. 

## VsCode and Packages
Install VSCode and the "C#", "Azure Account", "Azure App Service" package. 

## Running the Catalog Locally
Go to project folder "catalog", and `Run` -> `Start Debugging`. The catalog page will open in the browser. Note that there is no database attached to the project right now, and it is using memory.
