# 3. First Look at Azure

## The Azure Portal
`https://portal.azure.com/`. The `Azure portal` is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. The hamberger button on the upper left corner shows all the services provided by Azure, however, the `Search Bar` at the top is most commonly used. You can run commands using `Azure Cloud Shell` (Bash or PowerShell). 

## Subscription and Account
`Subscription` is a logical container for resources, while `account` is an identity with which you access resources in the subscription. A Subscription contains the various resources you provision in the cloud (VMs, DBs, networks etc. ). Every resource will be contained/created in a subscription. A subscription can be attached to multiple accounts. An account can also be attached to multiple subscriptions.
